### Demo Application Description

I used an application with basic UI interacting elements like checkbox, slider, press-and-hold, Drag-and-drop and Text Field. In this application, I automated four features and wrote 8 test cases. I also wrote the manual test cases in the EXCEL Sheet attached in this repositry as *Appium_Demo UI Test Cases.xlsx*. Below is the home page of the application.

### Description about the Automation

I used Appium framework for automating the tests in the above pages. Scripts are written in Python using Unittest Module and other supported libraries. Used Android Studio to get the emulator through ADB server to test teh automation. For writing the automation scripts using python, UI element attributes are identified by UIAutomatorViewer.

Below is the workflow in Appium Automation:
